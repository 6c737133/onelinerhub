# How to update data

```sql
ALTER TABLE tbl UPDATE col2 = 5 where col1 < 10
```

- tbl - name of the table to delete data from
- UPDATE col2 = 5 - update instructions (set ```col2``` column to ```5```, in our case)
- WHERE col1 < 10 - condition to update data on (```col1``` column less than ```10```, in our case)
