# Create an ArrayList with certain data type

```java
Arraylist<DataType> datas = new ArrayList<>();
// second way
List<DataType> datas = new ArrayList<>();
```

- ArrayList is an iterable object in java and subclass of Collection class.
- Left side defines the class of initialized instance, right side uses the constructor of stated class.
- You can use the constructor of subclasses on java it is a feature of polymorphism.
- You can't call methods from subclasses in that instance unless that method is overwritten in that subclass.
