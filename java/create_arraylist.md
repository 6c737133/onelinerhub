# Create an ArrayList with certain data type

You can use the constructor of subclasses on java it is a feature of polymorphism.
You can't call methods from subclasses in that instance unless that method is overwritten in that subclass.

```java
Arraylist<DataType> datas = new ArrayList<>();
```

- ArrayList - is an iterable object in java and subclass of Collection class
- DataType - data type to create
- new - constructor of stated class

other_way: using List class

```java
List<DataType> datas = new ArrayList<>();
```
