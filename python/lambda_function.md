# How to replace functions with Lambda functions

Very useful if you want to create one-use, one-liner functions on a program.

```python
lambda foo: foo+foo
```

- lambda foo - lamba function declaration (alterntive to standard function declaration `def sum(foo)`)
- : foo+foo - lamba function return value (the same as `return foo+foo` in standard function)
