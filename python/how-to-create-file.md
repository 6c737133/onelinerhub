# How to create file

```python
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
  f.write('text')
```

- `'file.txt'` - name of the file to create
- `'w'` - used so that we can write something into new file
- `f.write` - writes specified text into file
- `text` - text to write into file
- `with open` - opens specified file for manipulations
