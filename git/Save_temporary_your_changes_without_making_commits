## Save your changes without making commits with Git

````
git stash
````

Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. 
The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.


- git : base command
- stash : Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away just for you
