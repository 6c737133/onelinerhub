# How to find text

### Press `Esc` to [switch to command mode](/vim/how-to-switch-to-command-mode) and then type (then press `Enter`):

#### This method won't match upper case by default

```text
/<query> [enter]
```

- `/` - tells Vim we want to find text
- `<query>` - the text we want to find (regular expressions can be used)
